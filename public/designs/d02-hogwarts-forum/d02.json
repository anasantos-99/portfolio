    "I was contacted to create a design for a Harry Potter themed forum. Usually, I have full freedom with the creation of the design and layout, but with this one the forum administrators already had a lot of ideas for me to translate into HTML/CSS. I actually liked this, since this way I knew exactly what they had envisioned."
