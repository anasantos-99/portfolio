    "By the end of my third year in university, I was assigned a group project for creating an application to create volunteering events.",
    "The application was created with both a website using React and a mobile application for Android. However, I was mostly in charge of the mobile application as well as using Google Cloud Platform for the database and other features.",
    "The mobile application was implemented with Java. I created different features such as a Google login option, drawing maps and routes using Google Maps API, searching for events in the database and completing these events by going through the map markers."
